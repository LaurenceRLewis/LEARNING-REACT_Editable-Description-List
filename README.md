# LEARNING-REACT_Editable-Description-List
## Steps used to build the component

1. Created a new React component named DescriptionList.
2. Imported React and the useState hook.
3. Defined the initial state for the component, including a default name, an editMode state and a status state.
4. Returned JSX that renders a description list with a 
5. Description Term (DT) of "Name" and a Description 
6. Definition (DD) that displays the name state. If the 
7. editMode state is true, it renders a form with an input for the name and a save button. If the editMode state is false, it renders the DD with the name state and an "Edit name" button.
8. Created a CSS file and added styles for the description 
9. Imported the CSS file into the component file.
